### Flight record:
+ Flying: C-GVSA (Grob 103)
+ Tow: C-FAXQ (Cessna L-19)
+ Instructor pilot: Harald T
+ Takeoff time: 12:28
+ Landing time: 14:56
+ Logged time for this flight: **2:28**
+ Total glider flight time: **11:45** (hh:mm)

### Remarks
+ I had an oustanding flight with Harald this afternoon; I flew the tow behind AXQ up to a ~2500ft release on Hope Mountain, and easily climed to about 5000ft.
+ We flew over to Mount Ogilvie, ENE of Hope, but only found very narrow columns of lift, and essentially didn't gain any altitude from those areas. I asked Harald to handle most of this flying, as we were trying to find 'wave' lift conditions.
+ We managed to find some wave-like lift under cumulous clouds, roughly over Lake of the Woods, just north of Hope. I flew most of the climbing and lift here, at least until about 6500ft, when I handed it over to him to try to focus on 'wave' flight again.
+ I flew a large part of the climb up to about 7200ft. This was my **highest altitude to date!**
+ Stopped getting lift, flew over Dog Mountain and into the bowl, slowly lost altitude from about 4500ft down to about 2800ft; came in over the high key point and did another circuit of the bowl, climbed back up to about 3100 on the north side of the bowl.
+ Flew the circuit and dumped a lot of altitude (~1600ft to 800ft by the low key point) and handled the landing; reasonably smooth and short/regular-length landing.
