> Prologue: On my more focused and productive days, I feel most of the items on the list below. On my less-than-great days, I try to hear and feel at least one of them. I hope other entrepreneurs can relate.

1. I must keep showing up.
2. I must keep learning.
3. I must keep doing my best work.
4. I must keep deeply listening to other people.
5. I must keep connecting people who are searching for each other.
6. I must be at my best, in order to give my best.
7. I must not hold artificial expectations of myself, nor others, 100% of the time.
8. I must keep playing the long game.
9. I must keep trying to solve meaningful problems.
10. I must keep showing up.

### Just keep shipping.
