> Here are some of my favourite tools of 2016 that I use just about every day.

## In-Terminal
- [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - I especially love the (focus follows mouse cursor) feature.
- [Mosh](https://mosh.mit.edu/) - Super useful if you're working on shaky 3G/cellular connections to your server VMs.
- [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
- [OhMyZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/)

## Prototyping
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) - Absurdly powerful app, accessible UI, exports asset properties to valid CSS, super extensive plugin ecosystem. What more could you want in an app and UI prototyping platform?
- [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/) - Pretty much *the* Sketch plugin manager.
- [Framer](http://framerjs.com/)
- [SketchAppSources](http://www.sketchappsources.com/)
- [UI8](https://ui8.net/)

## 
- [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Panic Transmit

## Blogging etc
- Jekyll
