# Flight 15

### Goals:
+ 

<!--more-->

### Conditions at CYHE:
+ 15ºC at ~10:30 AM briefing, partly cloudy, light rain anticipated to roll through the Hope valley. Some blue sky patches to the east, but cloud rolling in from the west.

### Flight record:
+ Flying: C-GVSA (Grob 103)
+ Tow: C-FAQX (Cessna L-19)
+ Instructor pilot: Dave P
+ Takeoff time: 11:53
+ Landing time: 12:58
+ Logged time for this flight: **0:19**
+ Total glider flight time: **0:00**

### Remarks:
+ I flew the entire takeoff and tow; a little bit bumpy off the field, partly because I didn't gently pull back on the stick as is preferable, e.g. waiting for the nose and centre wheel to lift on it's own.
+ Very smooth flying conditions, huge contrast compared to consistent turbulence and bumpiness back in August.
+ Very confidence building experience with flying the entire tow, especially because it was such smooth flight. 
+ Released at 3000' over the middle of the bowl.
+ Getting back into coordinated medium and steep turns after 5 weeks without flying.
+ Flew the high key point over the Huskey station, still at about 1300 ft., did another coordinated left 360º turn, checked the two wind socks on the field, and flew to the Knoll, Dave took over the low key reference and final two left turns, lined up for the landing.
+ I handled all of the landing, although I was a little bit short (technically landing in the shorn long grass) and I should have flared the nose up a little bit more in the last few feet above the field.


# Flight 16

## Goals:
+ Practice gentle stalls, more assertive stalls, and stalling into a spin (hard rudder) and recovery.

### Conditions at CYHE:
+ Still about 15ºC, light showers rolling through the valley to the west.

### Flight Record:
+ Flying: C-GVSA (Grob 103)
+ Tow: C-FAQX (Cessna L-19)
+ Instructor pilot: Dave P
+ Takeoff time: 
+ Landing time: 
+ Logged flight time for this flight: **0:00**
+ Total glider flight time: **0:00**

### Remarks:
+ I flew the entire takeoff, much smoother this time with gentle back pressure on the stick, very smooth and predictable flying out from takeoff, good options lookout etc.
+ I handled the entire tow, including a box-the-wash with Daniel in AXQ; went down through the prop wash, to the lower left (a bit too far left,) top left, top right, and a bit of an aborted lower right before returning to the high tow.
+ Released at 3000ft over the center of the bowl again.
+ Practiced a few gentle stalls, more aggressive stalls, slow flight and coordinated (speed controlled) turns at about 40kn.
+ Dave demonstrated the more assertive stall and hard rudder to enter the spin, I repeated this 3 times with good CALL practice and lookout every time.
+ I handle the entire circuit entry, additional turn to lose 200ft to enter the high key at about 1100ft, flew the entire downwind leg to the reference point and low key; flew last two turns and entire final approach; very smooth landing.
+ Quite happy with this flight, reinforcing skills etc, feeling far less apprehensive and evasive about flying today compared to back in late August; cooler temperatures and fairly chilled club operations seem to help.
